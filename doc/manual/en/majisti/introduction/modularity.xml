    <title>Modularity</title>
    
    <para>A very known word in software development and of course, a lot of
        software are greatly successful by deciding to make their application
        extensible, but what does Majisti is exactly adding up to make
        everything more modular? </para>
    
    <para>The answer is simple, some very popular open-source Web CMS such as
        Joomla or Drupal do follow modular scalability where users can
        contribute their separate modules. Majisti is aiming for that
            <emphasis>philosophical way of thinking.</emphasis> Do not
        misunderstand, its design is not based on those CMS but the way to
        contribute extensions as a community. Majisti classes user contribution
        as an high priority where community driven development is what makes it
        grow, but it will be used in a much more restricted environment, where
        the core library is already based on other libraries. Also, Majisti is
        first and foremost aimed at developers and not users who don't have the
        required knowledge to develop Web applications. That does not mean that
        Majisti will never target a more user-oriented base, but its early
        versions are not focussed on that.</para>
