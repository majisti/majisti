    <title>Exceptions</title>

    <para>Again used by the core components, the exceptions can still be used
        from the library. Currently, Majisti provides those kind of exceptions:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para><methodname>NotImplementedException</methodname> When
                    something is not implemented yet.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para><methodname>UnsupportedOperationException</methodname>
                    For unsupported operations. Use carefully as it is argued
                    that throwing more exceptions in descending classes
                    inheritence is prohibited by some practitionners. The
                    exception to this is often the unsupported operation
                    exception, hence its presence.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
