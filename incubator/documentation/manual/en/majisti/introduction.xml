        Note that you should be already familiar with Zend Framework
        since this library is actually using it for its deployment. Moreover,
        Zend Frameworks terms are used in this documentation without explicitely
        defining what they do since it should be already knowns. For example,
        Zend_Application is used, but not described on how to configure it, only
        how to configure Majisti_Application. Another example would be an official
        module that uses Zend_Acl, it is considered that such components is already
        well known.
