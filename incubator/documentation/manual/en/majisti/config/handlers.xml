     Since Majisti Application is built solely on configuration,
     some more config handling was needed. Reading configuration is the
     responsability of Zend_Config and therefore no other tasks should be
     defined on how that read config is interpreted. Therefore, with config
     handlers, it is possible to parse specific configuration syntax.
     The following are the default configuration handlers shipped with Majisti.
