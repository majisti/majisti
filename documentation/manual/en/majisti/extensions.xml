    <title>Extensions</title>
    <subtitle>A better way to design rich applications with a small team, while
        having programming partnership with the entire world. -Steven Rosato</subtitle>
    
    <para>Extension is undeniably the top amongst Majisti's core components.
        Following the modularity Majisti is trying to accomplish, extensions
        form the library itself. Besides the core, extensions actually make the
        library become alive and usable. It completes the framework by adding
        its missing concreteness by using its well established abstractness. </para>
