    <title>Import</title>

    <para> The import handler listens on the import attribute in order for a configuration file to
        request, in other words import, another configuration file with the given path. The handler
        will override the parent configuration values, if duplicates are found, with the children
        configuration files imported. </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
[production]
property.applicationPath = /var/www
property.baseUrl = #{applicationPath}/someProject/public
property.configUrl = ../_files/imports

app.dir.applicationPath = #{applicationPath}
app.dir.images = #{baseUrl}/images
app.dir.root = /

import.foo = #{configUrl}/secondLvlFirstImport.ini
import.bar = #{configUrl}/secondLvlSecondImport.ini
]]></programlisting>

    <para> The above file is a parent configuration importing two external configurations. Let's
        look at the <filename>secondLvlFirstImport</filename> target the parent is requesting: </para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
app.dir.images = #{baseUrl}/images/OVERRIDEN
app.dir.new = #{baseUrl}/newFolder
]]></programlisting>

    <para> At the moment of merge, it is expected that the images directory will be overriden by the
        one found in the 2nd level file. Also, a new entry in the Zend_Config object will be created
        with the app.dir.new. </para>

    <para> Please note that the importation process is a recursive one, meaning any amount of
        imports can be made. By security measure, round-importing is prohibited. Here is an example
        to make it clearer: <programlisting>
File A imports file B
File B imports file A and C

Result: File A, B and C will be merged into a single Zend_Config object as expected. As circular-importing is prohibited, the fact that file B wants to import file A will simply be ignored and not taken into account.
</programlisting>
        <emphasis> It is crucial to name the entries of your configuration files with appropriate
            names so no undesirable overriding occurs. </emphasis>
