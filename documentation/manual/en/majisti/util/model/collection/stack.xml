    <para>
        The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. It implements
        classes IteratorAggregate and Countable  and provides the following operations : the usual
        push and pop, a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether
        the stack is empty, a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from
        the top, a method to clear the stack and also a method to transform the Stack into an array. 
    </para>
    <para>
        Stack is quite easy in it's usage. You simply create a new instance of Stack, with one or more elements to fill the stack with. 
        If you want to create a stack using an array, you would do something like:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
		$array = array('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
		$stack = new Stack($this->_indexedElements);
	</programlisting>
