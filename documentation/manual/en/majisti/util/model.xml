    <para>Here is the set of utility models that Majisti currently provides. It
        is mainly used by the core components, but are also available to anyone
        using the library. Keep note that Majisti is not a component or utility
        library and therefore it does not strive to provide all possible
        classes for a package, but wheter provide what was necessary for the
        core components and application development. Feel free to append other
        utility libraries.</para>
