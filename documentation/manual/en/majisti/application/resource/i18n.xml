    <title>I18n</title>
    
    <para>The <classname>I18n</classname> resource will basically just initiate
        a null translator. Every application should make use of a translation
        adapter, even if they are unilingual. By ensuring that a null
        translator is used, any time a given application needs to migrate to a
        multilingual website, it needs not to upgrade its code base, just
        switch to a concrete adapter (e.g: gettext), translate and be done with
        it.</para>
    <note>
        <para>The null translator always returns the same string it was asked
            to translate. When the application migrates into a multilingual
            one, you only need to switch the adapter.</para>
