    <title>Extension</title>

    <para> Extension is undeniably the top amongst Majisti's core components.
        Following one one the main point Majisti is trying to accomplish,
        extensions is what makes the framework itself. Besides the core,
        extensions actually make the framework become alive and usable. It
        completes the framework by adding its missing concreteness by using its
        well established abstractness. </para>

    <note>
        <para>Extensions located in MajistiX are the ones officially supported.
            Any custom extensions you may write up or find elsewhere on the net
            would go under MajistiC or in your own library. This section list
            the extensions available under MajistiX. </para>
