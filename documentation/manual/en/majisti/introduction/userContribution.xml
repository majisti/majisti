    <title>User Contribution</title>
    
    <para>User contribution is a big part of Majisti. In fact, the entire
        library is driven by it since it only provides tools for modularity.
        With no modules contributed well... no focus on business modeling is
        really achieved! </para>
    
    <para>We believe that concentrating on one simple and very concrete tasks is
        what is the easiest for developpers and this is why most people are
        making web applications on the fly - maybe using a framework - but still
        coding until it is done. Using abstraction is harder, requires more time
        and most of the time the end customer does not really care about the
        abstraction used within since usually that abstraction can even be used
        again for his competitors! Business modeling most interresting since its
        the process of designing something new, based on the current knowledge
        and experience. But business modeling usually covers so much of areas
        where everything must be focussed on the end user. So, how can we
        achieve everything without going insane?</para>
    
    <para>User contribution. Very well known by the open source community.
        By using modularity most of the business model is solved up with already contributed
        modules which are already proven successfull and working and the use case modeling
        sums up of configuring those modules and coding the models related to that business.
        In fact, after designing those models, the only thing left is building the actual website
        and its layout, provided you don't use the default templates shipped with the standard
        distribution! <emphasis>The key is to concentrate on business modeling</emphasis>.
    </para>
    
    <para>Majisti plans to use a proposal system which promotes user contributed
        modules to allow the most popular ideas to climb up the ladder as fast
        and possible and gather the maximum number of developers.</para>
