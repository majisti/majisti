    <title>Namespaces</title>

    <para>Majisti is entirely written with PHP5.3. Meaning that it makes use of
        the new features such as lamba functions, late static binding and
        namespaces. Those new features provide maximum flexibility and Majisti
        strives to make the best use of them. However, since Majisti uses Zend
        as its backbone framework, which is using a namespacing mechanism of
        its own, it cannot use PHP5.3 namespace everywhere. Trying to extend
        all the components to assure that every single one is PHP5.3 namespace
        compatible is not within Majisti's scope. Therefore, Majisti will rely
        and wait on Zend 2.0 to consider whether full PHP5.3 namespace would be
        needed. Currently, Majisti support PHP namespaces for those components:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>All core classes (e.g \Majisti\Config\Handler)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Application Resources, provided you add the "pluginsPath"
                    in the configuration. See <link
                        xlink:href="majisti.application.resources">Majisti
                        Application Resources</link> for more
                    information.</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>And the ones not supported by Majisti:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>View helpers, controller plugins and autoloaded resources
                    using the Module autoloader. They must use the Zend
                    Standard. (e.g. To instanciate a model you would do the
                    ApplicationName_Model_AModel convention to access it).
