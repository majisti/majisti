        Plugins are encapsulated code units that run when certain events occur.
        Zend Framework's controller architecture grants it's users the
        possibility to write code and make it happen when they want it.
        
        Majisti is continually developping plugins and modules that eases the 
        task of producing rich and well designed applications.
